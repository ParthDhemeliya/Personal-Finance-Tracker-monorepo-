# Personal Finance Tracker Backend

## ðŸ§ª Test Suite & Best Practices

This project includes a comprehensive, modular unit test suite for all major backend modules. The tests are designed and implemented following industry best practices to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

### **Test Coverage**

- **Modules Covered:**
  - Authentication (auth)
  - Balance
  - Budget (including management and overview)
  - Category
  - Expense
  - Income
  - Savings
  - Transaction
- **Test Types:**
  - Controller, service, repository, middleware, and validator tests
  - Both positive (success) and negative (error, unauthorized, not found, validation error) paths

### **Best Practices Followed**

- **Mocking:** All external dependencies (DB, services, models, JWT, etc.) are mocked using Jest (`jest.spyOn`, `jest-mock-extended`, etc.)
- **Isolation:** No real database or network calls are made; all tests are fast and isolated
- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert structure for clarity
- **Setup/Cleanup:** `beforeEach` is used to reset mocks and test state
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript types/interfaces are used throughout
- **Error Handling:** Negative paths check for thrown errors or that `next` is called with an error
- **Validation:** Validation logic is tested by mocking schema methods
- **Descriptive Names:** Tests use clear, descriptive names and are grouped logically
- **Linting/Formatting:** Code is clean, readable, and consistently formatted

### **How to Run Tests**

```
npx jest --coverage
```

- The test suite is expected to have a pass rate and code coverage above 80% for all major modules.
- Coverage reports are generated after each run.
